# SE-PB-TimeScript
 Just a simple programmable block script I made. Doesn't do much other than tell time in a funny manner. Will say "yellow51 was here" if you have an LCD named "yellow" and it has been set to Text & Images (works the same as with the time portion). https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3428257242
